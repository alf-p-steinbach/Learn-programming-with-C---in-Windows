The only good way to learn programming is by **doing**: trying out stuff, investigating, exploring, experimenting, making sure that one actually can do the things. And just implementing one’s own ideas, maybe wild ideas. I like that last part best.

Here at the start you get detailed guidance on how to *do* things. We’ll start by trying out the JavaScript hello-example from the first chapter, even if you’ve already done that on your own. Some variations follow.

But later on there will be progressively less and then no detailed how-to guidance for the *do*-ing. You are then expected to figure out things, because the most important and effective tool you have is **you**, your brain. And that includes both sides of that brain: both the right brain’s sense of aesthetic beauty, e.g. designing the perfect user interface, and the left brain’s analytical part that figures out how to make that design work so that it’s not just pretty cosmetics but actually a super-useful thing.

For example, at some point you may wonder, where to click or what to write in a command? That’s for you. You will **look** at what’s available to you and recognize it and just apply what you’ve already learned and use resources such as command help-texts, documentation (on the net and local), plain googling,

Good googling skills are important for programming. You will need to be able to sort out the wheat from the chaff in the search results. Because while artificial intelligence can help and does have a lot of knowledge, as of 2024 it still lacks common sense. And so there will be a lot of irrelevant results and a lot of low quality results, for you to sort out. You will need to be able to mostly ignore the irrelevant and the low quality, at a glance, and possibly follow vague clues for several levels of links, and dive right into the good helpful links. This ability comes with experience. By doing this many times.

### 2.1 &nbsp;“Hello, world!”.

In the first chapter you saw how JavaScript code can be “packaged” within HTML that can be fed to a web browser:

[*hello.js.html*](code/hello.js.html)

```html
<script>
    alert( 'Hello from JavaScript!' );
</script>
```

And I mentioned that to write source code like this you *can* use almost any text editor including Windows’ own Notepad.

In Windows 11 Notepad it looks like this:

Shortly you will need a better source code editor, a programmer’s editor like Notepad++ or Visual Code. For example, Notepad doesn’t help you with indenting and it doesn’t color parts of the source code according to purpose, and it may even try to foul up your work by adding a “.txt” filename extension after the “.html” (or whatever) that you specify. No doubt whoever programmed it had good intentions, a desire to help out the user, but it’s unfortunately help of the kind where you’re sleeping peacefully under a tree and a helpful friendly bear decides to swat a fly that lands on your nose&hellip;

However, partially in order to avoid installing anything new we’ll use Notepad in this chapter. Or rather, the explanations *assume* that you use Notepad here. You may of course use any other editor, and you may even recognize that you already master what some or all of these examples are about so that you can just skip ahead.

How does one then launch Notepad, and what are the important rules (not to be broken) about the source code text, and where should the file be saved, and how, and how is it fed to a web browser?

In the classic 1978 book “[The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)” the authors Kernighan & Ritchie, the K&R in “K&R C”, sidestepped these practical tool usage challenges by saying “check with a local expert”, and a book exclusively for students at teaching institutions usually doesn’t even say that explicitly, but just tacitly assumes that teaching assistants will fill the rôle of “local expert”.

Here I instead assume that you &mdash; or some reader &mdash; (1) is learning on your own; (2) is starting from scratch so that guidance is needed for all these questions; and (3) *has no local expert to consult*.
